# Unreleased

Nothing has merged since the second 6 October release yet.

**The last release is [6 October 2026, second release](2026-10-06-2.md)**, built from `8c7a9765` as
`main-AV4OTLR6.js` and tagged `dev-2026-10-06-4`. It carried the service-driven symbology: every layer
draws, and is named, the way its service publishes it. What was tested, and what went into it, are in
that file. The release before it, the same morning, is [6 October 2026](2026-10-06.md).

This file collects what merges from here until the next release. **A pull request with a user-visible
result adds its own entry below, in that pull request**, with its before/after screenshots linked from
`docs/screenshots/<slug>/` - and a row in *What to test on dev*. Nobody writes these later. See
[README.md](README.md#cutting-a-release).

## Summary

Nothing yet.

## What to test on dev

**The team tests these on dev before a release goes to production.** Dev is
[dev.aggiemap.tamu.edu](https://dev.aggiemap.tamu.edu). Each row is a change on dev and not yet on
production. A pull request with a visible result adds its own row; at release, the rows move into the
dated notes as what was tested, and this table empties.

**Currently on dev for testing:** nothing beyond the [second 6 October release](2026-10-06-2.md) itself.

## Work in flight â€” 6 October

Nothing below has merged, so it is not part of a release yet. This section exists because
[`CLAUDE_SETUP.md`](../../CLAUDE_SETUP.md) sends a session on another machine here first, and an empty
file would say the work had stopped.

### The Angular upgrade ([#1218](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1218)), in order

| 10b | Faster smoke suite ([#1426](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1426)) | merged ([#1477](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/pull/1477)): a release check runs one framing route per map, 6 workers, the ArcGIS library cached; 22 min 44 s on a workstation against about 1 h 50 min. Further cuts: [#1473](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1473) (bus test), [#1427](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1427) (maps) |
| 11 | `esri-loader` to `@arcgis/core`, 134 files | last |
| â€” | Dead projects ([#1226](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1226)) | VeoRide retired ([#1404](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/pull/1404)); the old Ring Day app goes after 10 October ([#1236](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1236)); CPA retires next ([#1458](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1458), tagged `cpa-last`), and the other unused projects are being listed ([#1457](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1457)); both are with the cloud session (Batch B on the `cloud-mailbox` branch) |
| â€” | After Angular 22 | standalone ([#1452](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1452)), `@defer` ([#1454](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1454)), signals and OnPush ([#1455](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1455)), zoneless ([#1478](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1478)), Vitest ([#1479](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1479)), accessibility rules back on ([#1474](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1474)); in that order after the cleanups. Ubuntu pins before 19 October: [#1407](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1407) (GitHub), [#1468](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1468) (Azure) |

**A local `nx affected` on a `package.json` change fails on projects that already fail on
`development`.** Every project counts as affected. Measured on 2 October: `cpa-angular`,
`ues-recycling-angular`, `signage-angular`, `ues-valves-angular` and `oidc-admin-angular` fail to build
on unchanged `development` (TypeORM and NestJS typings, signage typings, a missing `secrets` file);
NestJS builds fail on missing `ormconfig` files; three NestJS projects fail stale generator specs. CI
excludes all of them. Compare against this list, not the exit code. After any dependency change, prove
the lock file with a clean `npm ci` before pushing (CLAUDE.md, [#1347](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1347)).

### Also open

- **Pin CI runners to `ubuntu-24.04`** before `ubuntu-latest` moves to Ubuntu 26 on 19 October
  ([#1407](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1407), low).
- **`gisday-competitions-angular`'s page never answers when served locally** ([#1410](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1410), low);
  CI and Azure exclude the app.
- **Clicking a Ring Day popup throws in `TripPlannerConnectionService.connection`**, on production too
  ([#1411](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1411), medium). The popup still works.
- **The map probe should report popups**, so a test can see one carried between maps ([#1400](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1400),
  medium).
- **The shared flex mixins emit dead vendor prefixes** ([#1340](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1340), low priority), which makes
  reused CSS larger than hand-written.
- **Angular 16's parallel Sass compilation failed once on Azure** with "This file is already being
  loaded", on stylesheets that built cleanly before and since. If it recurs, it becomes its own issue.

### Also open from 1 and 2 October

- **Code Maroon needs an IIS proxy for its feed.** Dev reads a saved copy of the feed until then
  ([#1304](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1304), in the 2 October release). The fix is an IIS URL Rewrite and ARR rule
  with server-side caching, for dev only, to be arranged with the team that manages the server; the
  saved copy is removed once it is in place.
- **The browser console's build banner prints `___BUILD_DATE___` and the other placeholders** instead
  of the build's details ([#1306](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1306), low priority).
- **The old standalone Ring Day app** is removed after Ring Day, 8 to 10 October
  ([#1236](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1236)). The old Move-In app's deployed copy at `/movein/` still needs deleting
  ([#1235](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1235)).
- **Every map's starting center and zoom** to be checked against its data ([#1231](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1231)).
- **Signage does not build from its current source** ([#1226](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1226)).

### Waiting on someone else

**Bus route stops are a data fix, not a code fix
([#1174](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1174)).** Five
routes draw no stops â€” NW0104, NW0305, NW4041, 15R and 47/48 â€” and two draw the wrong number: 40 has
one extra, 47 two missing. The map matches each stop's `Route` field in the Bus Stops layer
(`TS/Bus_Routes/MapServer/0`) against the route code, and no stop carries those codes. The side panel
still lists their stops, because that comes from separate text fields.

**Megan maintains the bus data.** `bus.spec.ts` records the seven as known failures for dev, so the
nightly run shows each one going green as its data is corrected. Production deliberately has no
entries, so the test holds any bus release until the data is right.

### Read this first if you are picking up elsewhere

**726 screenshots exist only on the work machine.** They are in `test/visual/baselines/builder/`,
untracked and deliberately uncommitted â€” 363 builder destinations at two viewports, 325MB. They are
the output of a two-hour crawl against dev and can be regenerated with:

```bash
AGGIEMAP_SMOKE_BASE_URL=https://dev.aggiemap.tamu.edu BUILDER_INVENTORY_SHOTS=/some/dir \
  npx playwright test --config=tools/builder-inventory/playwright.config.ts
```

The capture resumes rather than restarts, so an interrupted run costs only what it had not reached.

They are uncommitted on purpose: at 325MB they would more than triple a 153MB repository,
permanently, since git keeps every version. Where they should live is
[#1107](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1107).

### A lesson from this release worth keeping

**A red smoke run is not automatically a code fault.** On the morning of 30 September the scheduled
run was red on both environments: 57 failures on production, one on dev. Every one of them was the
new tests running against builds that predated them â€” neither environment had been redeployed since
the 29 September release. Checking the deployed bundle settled it in minutes; debugging the
application would have wasted the morning.

Until a build can say which commit it came from
([#1148](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1148)), the smoke
suite tests a URL and cannot know what it verified, so this can happen after any merge that is not
promptly deployed.

### The decision waiting to be made

**[#1107](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1107) â€” evaluate
Visual Regression Tracker on the cluster** as the home for baseline images, with
[#1119](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1119) to stand it
up. Phase 0 is five decisions that need no VPN: hostname, TLS issuer, image storage, PVC size, and who
can log in.

The contained test is in #1107: stand VRT up, point the existing capture at `gameday-parking`'s 14
destinations, and find out whether its Playwright agent â€” about two years stale, while the server is
current â€” still works before migrating 726 images.

### Worth knowing before touching the visual work

- **Page captures are byte-identical across runs; map captures are not.** Measured three times each.
  So hash comparison works for pages and cannot work for maps, which need pixel tolerance
  ([#1105](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1105)).
- **A local dev server must be reached at `http://localhost:4200`, not `127.0.0.1`.** `TestingService`
  keys on the host containing `dev` or `localhost`, so `127.0.0.1` renders the *production* variant.
  That is deliberate and useful â€” it is the `local-production` test environment, and the way to capture
  production behaviour before deploying â€” but it is not what you want for everyday work.
- **The builder inventory is environment-specific** and the smoke suite refuses one captured
  elsewhere. Production has no inventory yet, so its builder maps still skip
  ([#1134](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1134)).
