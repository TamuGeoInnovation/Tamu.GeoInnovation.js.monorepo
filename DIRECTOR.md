# Who directs

**Director: home** (since 18 October 2026, 3:00 PM Central)

Each of the maintainer's machines runs a Claude Code session on this branch. **At any time exactly one machine
directs; every other machine listens.** The maintainer talks to the director. Every session reads this file first,
every time the branch changes. Which machine directs moves with the maintainer: home when he is at home, work when
he is at work.

## The machines

Each machine has a folder at the top of this branch, named after it, holding its `TASKS.md` (written only by the
director), its `STATUS.md` and its `reports/` (written only by that machine).

| Machine | Folder | Its job | Since |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| home | `home/` | Development: branches, agents, pull requests | 18 October 2026 |
| work | `work/` | Testing: smoke tiers, screenshot sets, `dev-*` tags | 18 October 2026 |

A machine's job does not change when the director does: a batch for a development machine is development work, a
batch for a testing machine is testing. The director, whichever machine it is, writes every listener's batches,
and does its own job itself.

## The director
- Is the only session that asks the maintainer anything, and the only one that takes instructions from him.
- Writes each listener's `<folder>/TASKS.md`, with each batch and a **Decided** list of his answers.
- Watches the branch and reads every listener's `STATUS.md` and reports as they land, so he relays nothing.
- Before asking him anything or writing a batch, reads every listener's `STATUS.md`, including **Told directly**,
  and never queues what a listener is already running.
- Applies the same rule to itself: work a listener is better placed for goes into that listener's batch, never
  done by the director on the side.

## Every listener
- Watches the branch with one background command that exits when it changes, for example
  `old=$(git ls-remote origin refs/heads/work-mailbox | cut -f1); until [ "$(git ls-remote origin refs/heads/work-mailbox | cut -f1)" != "$old" ]; do sleep 120; done`,
  then pulls and reads this file and its own `TASKS.md`.
- Does each new batch in its `TASKS.md`: pushes `<machine>: started` to its `STATUS.md` before anything runs, writes
  its report in `<folder>/reports/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<n>.md` and pushes `<machine>: finished` when it ends, records
  `Last batch done: N`, then watches again.
- **Never asks the maintainer anything, never offers or suggests work, and takes no decisions from him.** Each turn
  ends with a one-line status. Questions go in its report under **Questions for the director**, with options and a
  recommendation.
- Files issues **without a priority**; its report suggests one, and the director asks.
- Records ideas, possible work and things noticed under **Findings** in its `STATUS.md`. A finding is never a
  request and is never acted on until a batch asks for it; the director reads them and brings any worth doing
  to the maintainer. Batches not reached yet go under **Queued**, never mixed with findings.
- If the maintainer does tell it something, it does only that, and records it at once in its `STATUS.md` under
  **Told directly**, so the director never asks him again.

Every commit on this branch starts with the name of the machine that made it (`home:`, `work:`, ...), so each
session can tell its own pushes from the others'.

## Adding a machine
The maintainer pastes the start line on the new machine with its name and job added, for example:

    Pull TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo, check out the work-mailbox branch, and do what DIRECTOR.md says. This machine is "lab", and its job is testing.

The new machine creates its folder (`lab/TASKS.md` saying "No batch yet", `lab/STATUS.md`, `lab/reports/`),
pushes them with `lab: joined`, and listens. The director adds its row to the table above when it sees that
commit, and from then on writes its batches. A machine is a listener unless the first line of this file names it.

## Handing over
The maintainer tells the **current director**: "hand over to work" (or any machine's name). The director:
1. finishes or parks what it is doing, and writes **Handover** below: what is in flight on every machine, the open
   questions (numbered, with recommendations), what is waiting on whom, and what comes next;
2. changes the first line to the new director, with the time (US Central), and pushes;
3. becomes a listener: watches its own `TASKS.md`.

The named machine is listening, so it sees the change within minutes and takes over: it reads **Handover**, tells
the maintainer it now directs, and asks him the open questions. He pastes nothing. If its session was closed, the
start line is the same for every machine:

    Pull TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo, check out the work-mailbox branch, and do what DIRECTOR.md says.

## Stopping
A `## Stop` heading in a listener's `TASKS.md` stops that listener: it writes `Stopped at <time>` in its
`STATUS.md`, pushes, and ends. The director adds it when the maintainer says the day's work is done.

## Handover

(Written by the director when it hands over. Empty while no handover is in progress.)
