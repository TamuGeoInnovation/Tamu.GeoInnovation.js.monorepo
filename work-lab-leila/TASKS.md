# work-lab-leila: current tasks

Written only by the director (see `DIRECTOR.md`). You write `work-lab-leila/STATUS.md` and
`work-lab-leila/reports/`, never this file.

**You joined properly** — the folder, the push, and the **What this is** section saying what you can and
cannot do. That last part is the useful one: it changed what you are being asked to do. You have 64 GB and
24 CPUs, the most of any machine here, and no `gh` CLI. So you get work that wants the machine to itself and
ends in a report, never in a pull request. The director does the GitHub half.

**You are a listener.** Do the batch, report, and stop. Don't offer or start other work. Questions go in your
report under **Questions for the director**, with options and a recommendation — never to the maintainer.

## Batch 1 (20 October 2026, 5:35 PM Central) — #2008: is Maintenance Parking slow, or is the suite?

**[#2008](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/2008)** (filed today).
`/parking/maintenance-parking` fails `map-layers.spec.ts`'s 240-second settle limit when the suite runs with
6 workers, and passes when run alone — twice on 20 October, on two different machines and two different
builds. Nobody knows yet whether the map is slow or the measurement is.

**This is your batch because of the hardware, not in spite of it.** On the testing machine 6 workers is
heavy contention; on 24 CPUs it is not. That difference is the experiment.

### What to run

Against **production** (`https://aggiemap.tamu.edu`), which is serving `prod-2026-10-20` / `8463ac6af`:

1. `test/smoke/aggiemap/run-local.sh production one map-layers.spec.ts --retries=0` — the whole spec, the
   default worker count. Record how long Maintenance Parking took and whether it passed.
2. The same again with `--workers=6`, to match the runs that failed.
3. `run-local.sh production one maintenance-parking --retries=0` — that map alone, as a control.

Record for each: pass or fail, the map's own settle time, the worker count, and what else was running on the
machine (nothing, ideally — see **Nothing heavy beside a run** in `DIRECTOR.md`; this batch is measuring
timing, so a second container ruins it).

### What the answer looks like

- **It passes on 24 CPUs at 6 workers** → the limit is tracking machine load, not the map. The suite is
  wrong to express "too slow" as a fixed wall-clock number that depends on who else is using the CPU. Say so,
  and suggest what it should do instead.
- **It fails here too** → the map really is too slow, and it belongs with
  [#1897](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues/1897)'s family of maps
  that load every parking space on campus. Say roughly how slow, and whether Service Parking behaves the same.

Either answer is a result. **Don't fix anything** — this batch is a measurement, and which fix is right
depends on which answer you get.

### Also worth a line in your report

Your `STATUS.md` mentions a fix on `fork/docs/aggiemap-dev-server-env` for `CLAUDE_SETUP.md` Phase 5 hanging
without `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` and `NX_WORKSPACE_DATA_DIRECTORY`. **That is a real finding and it has no issue
behind it**, which in this repository means the work does not exist. Say in your report what the symptom was,
what the two settings change, and whether it is specific to your machine or would bite anyone — and the
director will file it and open the pull request. Don't open either yourself.

### House rules that will catch you out

- **Times are US Central**, read from PowerShell. `TZ=America/Chicago date` silently returns UTC on these
  machines and labels it `GMT`. `CLAUDE.md` has the conversion.
- **Never pipe `nx` output into `tail`, `head` or `grep`** — the pipeline's exit code hides the task's.
  Redirect to a file, capture the exit code, then filter.
- **A tag is a claim; the bundle hash is the proof.** When you report a run against production, say which
  bundle it served, read from the page — not which tag you expected.

## Batch 2 (20 October 2026, 5:50 PM Central) — the three parking fixes, checked **together**

**Do this after batch 1, not beside it.** Batch 1 is a timing measurement; a build running next to it would
make its numbers meaningless. Finish #2008, push the report, then start this.

Three branches are about to become three pull requests. Each one has been checked on its own and each is
green. `CLAUDE.md` asks for one more thing before a batch of pull requests is merged, and **nobody has done
it for these**:

> Before a batch is merged, check all of its PRs merged together: two PRs can each pass CI and still fail
> together.

That is this batch. It matters more than usual here, because these three are not independent: two of them
change **shared libraries** (`maps-esri`, `maps-feature-legend`) and one moves a helper into
`common.definitions.ts`, which other maps import. Separately green, together broken is exactly the shape
this produces.

### The branches, on the fork, already merged with the latest `development`

| Branch | Head | Closes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fix/1991-vendor-parking-lots` | `155f074a1` | #1991 |
| `fix/1992-accessible-parking-sports-maps` | `248ef407e` | #1992, #1993 |
| `fix/1992-legend-multi-value-class` | `e5a66b132` | #2004 |

Use those exact commits. Documentation and screenshot commits may be added on top while you work — they do
not change any code, so do not re-fetch chasing a moving head.

### What to do

1. **Merge all three onto the latest `origin/development`**, in a worktree of its own, in the order above.
   Report any conflict and what it was in, even if it is trivial to resolve — a conflict between two fixes is
   itself a finding, and the director needs to know before deciding merge order.
2. **Push that combined branch to the fork** as `check/2026-10-20-three-parking-fixes`. This is deliberate:
   your `STATUS.md` says SSH pushes depend on the maintainer's `ssh-agent` staying alive, and it is better to
   discover that on a throwaway branch than on work somebody is waiting for. **If the push fails, say so in
   your report with the exact error and carry on** — the rest of the batch does not need it.
3. **Run the full affected check** on the combined branch:
   `scripts/check-in-volume.sh check/2026-10-20-three-parking-fixes`. Not a narrow project list: two shared
   libraries change, so the point is everything they affect. Report the exit code and the per-target counts
   (`Successfully ran target lint for N projects`), not just "passed".
4. **Build it for production and run `map-layers.spec.ts` against that build**, the way home did for each
   branch alone. The four maps the three fixes touch — `/parking/vendor-parking`,
   `/events/womens-basketball`, `/parking/indoor-track-parking`, `/parking/softball-parking` — must all pass,
   **and so must the other 60-odd**. A fix to a shared legend library that fixes four maps and quietly breaks
   a fifth is the thing this batch exists to catch.
   Expect `/parking/maintenance-parking` to be the one known failure, which is batch 1's subject.

### What a good report says

- The exit code and counts for the check, and whether anything conflicted when merging the three.
- `map-layers.spec.ts` on the combined build: passed, failed, skipped, and **every failure named with its
  map**, compared against home's result for the same spec on its own combined build: **57 passed, 12 skipped,
  1 failed** (Maintenance Parking).
- Whether the push worked.
- Anything that passed alone for home and fails here, which is the whole point.

**Don't fix anything, don't open anything.** If something fails together that passed apart, that is the
result — report it and stop. The director decides what happens next.
