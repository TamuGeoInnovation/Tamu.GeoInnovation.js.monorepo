        <p>
          Each year, TxGIS Day hosts a Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) data collection competition to engage students, faculty, staff, and other GIS Day participants to get out there and collect some data that is meaningful to the mission of TxGIS Day. The competition has prizes, and allows participants to have an impact on our campus.

        <h2 class="trailer-1">Prior Competitions</h2>
        <h3>2021: <a href="/competitions/lightpole/">TAMU Light Pole Challenge</a></h3>
        <p><strong>The What:</strong>TxGIS Day participants were asked to submit data in the form of photos and a questionnaire of light poles around the TAMU campus using their personal cell phones through the TxGIS Day app. </p>
        <p><strong>The Why:</strong>The project team and the competition sponsors wanted to inventory the types, qualities, and locations of light poles on campus. These submissions will be used to help improve lighting across the TAMU campus.</p>
        <p><strong>The Who:</strong>Texas A&M Center for Geospatial Sciences, Applications and Technology</p>

        <h3>2020: No competition held</h3>
        <h3>2019: <a href="/competitions/signage/">TAMU Signage Survey</a></h3>

        <p><strong>The What:</strong> TxGIS Day participants were asked to submit data in the form of photos of permanent signage on the TAMU campus using their own personal cell phones through the TxGIS Day app.</p>
        <p><strong>The Why: </strong>The project team and the competition sponsors wanted to inventory the types, qualities, and locations of permanent signage on campus. These data will be used to create a plan for addressing branding, consistency, and quality issues related to the signage on and about Texas A&amp;M campus.</p>
        <p><strong>The Who:</strong> TAMU Office of Mapping &amp; Space Information, TAMU Geography, TAMU Office of the University Architect, TAMU GeoInnovation Service Center.</p>

        <h3>2018: <a href="/competitions/stormwater/">TAMU Stormwater Survey</a></h3>

        <p><strong>The What:</strong> TxGIS Day participants were asked to submit data in the form of photos of the TAMU stormwater drainage infrastructure using with their own personal cell phones through the TxGIS Day app.</p>
        <p><strong>The Why: </strong>The project team wanted to gather images of places on campus where stomrwater runoff and drainage infrastructure was or was not operating efficiently and as designed. These data will be used to develop a model of areas on campus that are prone to flooding and incorporate the data into the Aggiemap routing network to increase the reliability of trip planning during inclement weather for students, staff, faculty, and visitors on the TAMU campus.</p>
        <p><strong>The Who:</strong> TAMU Office of Mapping &amp; Space Information, TAMU Geography, TAMU GeoInnovation Service Center.</p>

        <h3>2018: <a href="/competitions/sidewalk/">TAMU Sidewalk Challenge</a></h3>

        <p><strong>The What:</strong> TxGIS Day participants were asked to submit data in the form of photos of any place on campus where a sidewalk was present using with their own personal cell phones through the TxGIS Day app.</p>
        <p><strong>The Why: </strong>The project team wanted to gather images of places on campus where sidewalks could be found. By identifying the type, location, and condition, these data will allow the generation of a model that can be incorporated into Aggiemap to increase the reliability of ADA accessible trip planning, providing trip routes with least resistance and hazards for users with vision or mobility impairments.</p>
        <p><strong>The Who:</strong> TAMU Division of Information Technology, TAMU Geography, TAMU GeoInnovation Service Center.</p>

        <h3>2017: <a href="/competitions/building-bounty/">TAMU Building Bounty</a></h3>

        <p><strong>The What:</strong> TxGIS Day participants were asked to submit data in the form of photos of the exterior of TAMU structures using with their own personal cell phones through the TxGIS Day app.</p>
        <p><strong>The Why: </strong>The project team wanted to gather images of the exterior of all structures on the TAMU campus including buildings, greenhouses, water towers, and any/all other structures that reside on our beautiful campus in order to use Structure From Motion (SFM) techniques to develop a 3D textured model of the TAMU Campus.</p>
        <p><strong>The Who:</strong> TAMU Geography, TAMU GeoInnovation Service Center.</p>
        <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> Resulted in the development of a 3D Aggiemap - Coming Soon!</p>

        <h3>2016: <a href="/competitions/aggie-accessibility/">Aggie Accessibility</a></h3>
        <p><strong>The What:</strong> TxGIS Day participants were asked to submit data in the form of photos of accessible and inaccessible features of campus using with their own personal cell phones through the TxGIS Day app.</p>
        <p><strong>The Why: </strong> The project team wanted to locate, document, and assess features of the Texas A&amp;M campus that make our university grounds and facilities accessible (or inaccessible) in order to determine the best plan for improving accessibility on the TAMU campus.</p>
        <p><strong>The Who:</strong> TAMU Geography, TAMU GeoInnovation Service Center, TAMU Disabilities Services, TAMU Office of Mapping and Space Information, TAMU Transportation Services.</p>
        <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> Resulted in the development of a routing service for those with mobility limitations on <a href="https://aggiemap.tamu.edu" target="_blank">AggieMap</a>!</p>

        <h3>2015: <a href="/competitions/manhole/">Manhole Mapping</a></h3>
        <p><strong>The What:</strong> TxGIS Day participants were asked to submit data in the form of photos of all manholes and handholds on the TAMU campus using with their own personal cell phones through the TxGIS Day app.</p>
        <p><strong>The Why:</strong>The project team wanted to assist TAMU IT with the locating, documenting, and assessment of the underground fiber optic network of the Texas A&amp;M campus.</p>
        <p><strong>The Who:</strong> TAMU Geography, TAMU GeoInnovation Service Center, TAMU IT.</p>
        <p><strong>The Impact:</strong> Resulted in the identification and location of the TAMU fiber network!</p>
