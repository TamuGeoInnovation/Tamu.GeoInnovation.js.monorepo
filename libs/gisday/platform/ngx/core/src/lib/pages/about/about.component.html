        <h2 class="trailer-1">GIS Resume Bank</h2>
        <div class="column9 content-block">
          <p>The TxGIS Day Committee has unique and personal relationships with many employers in the fields of Geography, Geographic Information Science & Technology (GIST), and the broader Geospatial Industry. These employers are actively seeking to recruit undergraduate, graduate, and former students from Texas A&amp;M University, The University of Texas at Austin, the University of North Texas, and many other schools and colleges to fill full time and internship roles.</p>
          <p>In 2018, the TxGIS Day Committee organized the first TxGIS Day Resume Bank to make sure that our current and former students receive the highest number of resume reviews by the highest number of potential employers. This resource is provided to companies and organizations who request access to TxGIS Day's best GIS students from across the state.</p>
          <p class="aggie-weight-4 leader-1">Participation</p>
          <p>Any current or former student at a participating TxGIS Day college or univeristy is eligible to add her or his resume to our GIS Resume Bank.</p>
          <p>Participation in this initiative is voluntary on the part of our students. No student will be required to add her or his resume to the TxGIS Day Resume Bank as a condition for graduation or grades in a course. A student's optional contribution of her or his resume into the GIS Resume Bank will be used to help her/him/them find an internship or full time position. Accordingly, any information voluntarily provided by a student into this system will be shared with potential employers on their behalf as requested by employers.</p>
          <p class="aggie-weight-4 leader-1">Student Resume Inclusion Criteria</p>
          <p>Quality standards will apply. If your resume does not reflect well on yourself or TAMU, it will not be included in the TAMU GIS Resume Bank. You may or may not be notified if this is the case, depending on the volume of resumes submitted.</p>
          <p>Current and former students may resubmit their resume as many times as they would like as new experience, skills, etc. are obtained and their resume gets better and better. Only the latest submission will be shared with potential employers.</p>
          <p class="aggie-weight-4 leader-1">Student Resume Submission Guidelines</p>
          <p>Current and former students who wish to add their resume to the GIS Resume Bank should:</p>
