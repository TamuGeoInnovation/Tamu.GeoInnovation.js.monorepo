        <p>This year we are yet again bringing hands-on GIS data collection to the masses. In collaboration with the Texas A&M Department of Geography and Texas and the Texas A&M GeoInnovation Service Center, we are hosting the TAMU Lighting Challenge.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the challenge is cover as much of the campus surface with surveys that gauge the state of exterior lighting to gain insights on the following points:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Safety and Security</strong>: Adequate lighting is crucial for the safety and security of students, faculty, and visitors. Collecting data on campus lighting helps identify poorly lit areas that may pose safety risks, enabling targeted improvements to enhance overall security.</li>
          <li><strong>Infrastructure Planning</strong>: The data collected can provide valuable insights for future infrastructure planning. Understanding the current lighting conditions helps in making informed decisions about where new lighting installations are needed or where existing infrastructure requires upgrades.</li>
          <li><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>: The data collected can be used to identify areas where lighting is excessive or inefficient. This information can be used to develop strategies for reducing energy consumption and costs.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Adequate lighting is essential for creating an inclusive and accessible environment. Assessing lighting conditions can help identify areas where adjustments are needed to ensure that the campus is accessible to everyone, including those with visual impairments.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This competition is proudly sponsored by:</p>

      <div class="trailer-4" id="sixteen">
        <h2 class="trailer-1">Eligibility</h2>

        <p>While we encourage everyone to download the app and submit data, only current TAMU graduate and undergraduate students are eligible to win.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="trailer-4" id="two">
        <h2 class="trailer-1">Rules, Participation, and Winners</h2>

        <p>In order for a chance to win, participants will be required to have an active TxGIS Day account. Using the official <a routerLink="/app">Official TxGIS Day Competitions App</a>, users will complete surveys on campus lighting anywhere ib main and west campus, riverside campus, and anywhere that you think is TAMU land and submit them.</p>

        <p>Only participant submissions collected during the three days of TxGIS Day and before the Awards Ceremony will be included as eligible submissions (12:01AM Monday - 12:45PM Wednesday). The sponsoring organizations would certainly appreciate the efforts of people who collect data before and after TxGIS Day, so feel free to start collecting early and continue collecting after, but these submissions will not be considered for an award.</p>

        <p>The participant with the highest number of points from verified submissions at the conclusion of the TxGIS Day event will be awarded 1<sup>st</sup> place. The next highest number will be awarded 2<sup>nd</sup> place, and the next 3<sup>rd</sup> place.</p>

        <p>Winners will be awarded with prizes generously provided by the Texas A&amp;M Department of Geography and the Texas A&amp;M GeoInnovation Service Center.</p>

        <p>Winners will be announced on Wednesday, November 15 at the Lunch and Awards session.</p>

        <p>Participants do not need to be present at the Awards Ceremony in order to be selected as a winner.</p>

          <h2 class="trailer-1">Why is this study being done?</h2>

          <p>The purpose of this study is to leverage the data collection abilities of the 2,500+ TAMU faculty, students, staff, and visitors who participate in the TxGIS Day events per year to gather data about the TAMU campus. Each year, the TxGIS Day planning committee organizes a GIS Mapping Competition where TxGIS Day participants gather data (GPS, photos, and other attributes) of amenities and services on campus. You are invited to participate in these data collection efforts!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="four">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">Why am I being asked to be in the study?</h2>
          <p>You are being asked to be in this study because you have a relationship with Texas A&amp;M either as a faculty or staff member, a student, or a visitor.</p>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="five">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">How many people will be asked to be in the study?</h2>
          <p>The study organizers hope to engage 2,500 study participants per year for each of the four years of the project. We will contact 50,000 people per year (roughly the number all TAMU students, faculty, and staff) in order to achieve these participant numbers for each year of the project.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="six">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">What are the alternatives to being in this study?</h2>
          <p>The alternative to being in the study is not to participate. Participation in this study is not mandatory, and non-participation will not impact you in any fashion.</p>
        </div>
