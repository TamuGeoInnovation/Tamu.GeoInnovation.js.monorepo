      <div class="column9 content-block">
        <p>GIS stands for Geographic Information Systems. GIS uses location technology to answer questions, make better decisions, and solve some of the world’s toughest problems. It is the Science of Where.</p>
        <p>GIS Day is an international celebration of GIS technology. Around the globe, GIS professionals dedicate time to sharing their knowledge and accomplishments with others.</p>
        <p>GIS Day event planners, from around Texas, have joined forces to host the first state-wide GIS Day for Texas. TxGIS Day is a free, virtual event for high school students and teachers. Our goal is to introduce GIS to high school students and help you inspire future GeoGeeks!</p>
