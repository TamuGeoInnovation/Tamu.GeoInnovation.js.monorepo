        <p>This project aims at spatially analyzing the Trimet's transit stops accessibility in Portland, Oregon. Some of the factors to analyze are:</p>

        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Connectivity distance, bus frequency and active transportation availability.</li>
          <li>Linking transit station with land use zoning for possible transit oriented approach - multi-dwelling unit, mixed-use zoning, mixed and commercial employment.</li>
          <li>LInking American Community Services Data (ACS) - median income and population to identify study area to provide equity in terms of transit accessibility.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dune ripples have long been used to determine wind direction on Mars, a technique made possible by their large scale compared to their Earthen counterparts. However, ripple orientations can be affected by gravity on steep slopes, impacting scientific results. This research is part of a study which utilizes equations from Howard (1977) to correct this issue.</p>

        <h2 class="trailer-1">Potential Windfarm Locations in South Texas</h2>
        <p>The U.S. is highly dependent on fossil fuels and coal for its energy sources. The Texas electrical grid is about 75% dependent on coal and natural gas, both of which are nonrenewable resources that emit CO2, NOx, and SOx, compounds when burned. Energy maps show that Texas has the highest potential wind capacity than any other state, and there is potential for far more wind farm installations. There have been great movements toward using wind and solar power energy in the U.S. over the last decade. One of the quickest growing areas is the South Texas region which is known for its flat land and perpetual wind. Some windfarms already exist in this area, but some energy companies may be looking to expand into this area and provide more options for consumers.</p>

        <h2 class="trailer-1">Land Cover Detection Analysis: 19 Years of Change in the Southwest Travis County Groundwater Conservation District</h2>
        <p>As population in the Austin metropolitan area is exponentially increasing (United States Census Bureau), land becomes heavily developed to make room for growth. An increase in developed lands can have a negative impact on vulnerable groundwater resources. Less permeable surfaces like pavement limit aquifer recharge and create more risk for pollutants. Additionally, urbanization creates higher demand on the aquifer. To identify the rate of land cover change, Southwest Travis County Groundwater Conservation District (SWTCGCD) has requested Austin Community College (ACC) to perform a GIS analysis to visualize how the environment has changed over time.</p>

        <p>According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), obesity in adults have a prevalence of approximately 42.4% in the U.S., deeming it one of the most prevalent chronic diseases nation-wide. Though abundant work has been done on identifying risk factors, a lack of research focuses on the spatial patterns of obesity.</p>

        <h2 class="trailer-1">Topographic and Atmospheric Effects on Wildfire</h2>
        <p>Table Mountain Pine is a species endemic to the Appalachian Mountains. In the Southern region of its range, it is predominantly found on South-facing slopes, which is typical for xerophytic, pyrophilic species. However, in the Northern extent, the distribution is skewed towards North and Northwest-facing slopes (Lafon et al., 2019). One explanation for this phenomenon is that the spatial distribution of wildfires match that of the pines in the Northern and Southern regions. If the distributions match, then local weather data for the times of the fires should be answered to help indicate whether fires burn where they do due to the presence of pines, or pines are located where they are due to fire presence.</p>

          <li>In addition to being medication experts and medication providers, Pharmacists provide other important health services. These include immunization services and medication therapy management.</li>
          <li>Pharmacies are increasingly in short supply especially in rural and low income areas. This often contribute to reduced medication adherence.</li>
          <li>Despite the reduced pharmacy access, not much is known about pharmacy access and its ultimate impact on patients health status.</li>
