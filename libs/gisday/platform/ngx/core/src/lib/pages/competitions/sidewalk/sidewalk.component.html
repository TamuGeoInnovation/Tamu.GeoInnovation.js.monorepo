        <p>This year we are yet again bringing hands-on GIS data collection to the masses. In collaboration with Texas A&amp;M Department of Geography and Texas A&amp;M Division of Information Technology, we are hosting the TAMU Sidewalk Challenge. The purpose of the challenge utilize crowd-sourced photos and surveys submitted by members and guests of the TAMU community to generate a comprehensive map of location, types, and condition of sidewalks in our beautiful campus that will be used in future research studies. This event is proudly sponsored by the following organizations:</p>

        <div class="icon-grid leader-1 trailer-1">

            <img src="/assets/images/sponsors/TAMU_Division_of_IT_Logo_2018.svg" alt="TAMU" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Throughout the course of the three-day long TxGIS Day event(s), any TxGIS Day participant will be able to submit data in the form of photos and survey responses of any area on campus where a sidewalk exists, with their own personal cell phones through the official TxGIS Day Competition App.</p>

        <p>How data collection works:</p>
        <ul class="numbered-custom">
          <li>Install the TxGIS Day Competitions App on your mobile device (Android or iOS).</li>
          <li>Find the nearest continuous sidewalk.</li>
          <li>In the app, find the competitions tab (denoted by a camera) and select "Sidewalk Challenge".</li>
          <li>Take a picture with the app.</li>
          <li>Provide details on the photo you are submitting, including the type, condition, and a brief description for your selections.</li>
          <li>Submit the survey, and proceed to the next sidewalk!</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="leader-2">How competition points work:</p>

        <div class="flex flex-row justify-around leader-1 trailer-2">
          <img class="medium" src="/assets/images/graphics/graphic-sidewalk-1pt.svg" alt="1 Point" />
        </div>

        <ul>
          <li>A sidewalk is any continuous length of paved path of the same material.</li>
          <li>If you provide a completely filled survey and a photo, you receive <strong>one</strong> point for every survey submitted.</li>
          <li>Whoever gets the most points, wins the competition.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="three">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">Why is this study being done?</h2>

          <p>The purpose of this study is to leverage the data collection abilities of the 2,500+ TAMU faculty, students, staff, and visitors who participate in the TxGIS Day events per year to gather data about the TAMU campus. Each year, the TxGIS Day planning committee organizes a GIS Mapping Competition where TxGIS Day participants gather data (GPS, photos, and other attributes) of amenities and services on campus. You are invited to participate in these data collection efforts!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="four">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">Why am I being asked to be in the study?</h2>
          <p>You are being asked to be in this study because you have a relationship with Texas A&amp;M either as a faculty or staff member, a student, or a visitor.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="five">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">How many people will be asked to be in the study?</h2>
          <p>The study organizers hope to engage 2,500 study participants per year for each of the four years of the project. We will contact 50,000 people per year (roughly the number all TAMU students, faculty, and staff) in order to achieve these participant numbers for each year of the project.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="six">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">What are the alternatives to being in this study?</h2>
          <p>The alternative to being in the study is not to participate. Participation in this study is not mandatory, and non-participation will not impact you in any fashion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="seven">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">What will I be asked to do in this study?</h2>

          <p>You will be asked to walk around the TAMU campus and take pictures of buildings. In 2019, you are being asked to take pictures of the exteriors of TAMU structures. In future years, the organizing committee will survey different aspects of the TAMU campus.</p>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="eight">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">Are there are risks to me?</h2>

          <p>The things that you will be doing are no greater than the risks you would come across in everyday life. While collecting data, you will be submitting your location (actually the location of the thing you are collecting about), which could expose the locations that you collected data at, should these data be stolen. Other risks include a breach of confidentiality should study information about you (name, email, TAMU department, and TAMU classification) be stolen.</p>
