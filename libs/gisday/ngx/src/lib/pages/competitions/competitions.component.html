        <p>
          Each year, Texas A&amp;M GIS Day hosts a Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) data collection
          competition to engage students, faculty, staff, and other GIS Day participants to
          get out there and collect some data that is meaningful to the mission of Texas A&M. The competition has
          prizes, and allows participants to have an impact on our campus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Due to historically successful participation by the community, this year we are excited to offer the Campus
          Signage Challenge!
