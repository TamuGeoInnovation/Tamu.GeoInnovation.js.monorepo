        <p>
          Each year, TxGIS Day hosts a Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) data collection competition to engage students, faculty, staff, and other TxGIS Day participants to get out there and collect some data that is meaningful to the mission of Texas A&M. The competition has prizes, and allows participants to have an impact on our campus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Due to historically successful participation by the community, this year we are excited to offer the Campus Signage Challenge!
