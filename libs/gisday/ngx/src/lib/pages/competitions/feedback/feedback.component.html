            Found a particular session too easy or too difficult? Would you like to see something else entirely? Let us know! We want to ensure that future attendees come out of GIS Day at Texas A&amp;M with a positive learning experience so that they may further the GIS practice beyond our event.
          </p>

          <p>We invite all event participants to submit their opinion and feedback on any attended event that will be used to improve the quality and experience of future GIS Day events. For <strong>every</strong> feedback submission, participants earn an opportunity to win free Esri products sponsored by Esri.</p>
