          This year we are yet again bringing hands-on GIS data collection to the masses. In collaboration with the Texas A&amp;M Department of Geography, the Texas A&amp;M Office of Mapping &amp; Space Information, the Texas A&amp;M Office Division of Information Technology, and the Texas A&amp;M Office of the University Architect, we are hosting the TAMU Permanent Signage Challenge.
        </p>

        <p>The purpose of the challenge is to locate and categorize all permanent signage features on campus from crowd-sourced photos and surveys submitted by the members and guests of the TAMU community. This event is proudly sponsored by the following organizations:</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Throughout the course of the three-day long GIS Day event(s), any GIS Day participant will be able to submit data in the form of photos and survey responses of any permanent signage features <b>on</b> our beautiful campus including (but not limited to) stop, yield, parking (reserved, visitor, business), wheelchair accessible, bus stop, and building signs with their own personal cell phones through the <a href="/App/">Official Texas A&amp;M GIS Day Competitions App</a>.</p>

        <p>Features not allowed as a valid submission include posters, lawn signs, or any other temporary sign.</p>

        <p>
          How data collection works:

        <h2 class="trailer-1">Eligibility</h2>

        <p>While we encourage everyone to download the app and submit data, only current TAMU graduate and undergraduate students are eligible to win.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="trailer-4" id="two">
        <h2 class="trailer-1">Rules, Participation, and Winners</h2>

        <p>In order for a chance to win, participants will be required to <a href="/Signup/ ">have an active GIS Day account</a>. Using the official <a href="/App/">Official Texas A&amp;M GIS Day Competitions App</a>, users will take photos of any and all permanent signage on the TAMU campus. Capture permanent signage on main campus, west campus, riverside campus, and anywhere that you think is TAMU land and submit them.</p>

        <p>Only participant submissions collected during the three days of TAMU GIS Day and before the Awards Ceremony will be included as eligible submissions (12:01AM Monday - 11:15AM Wednesday). The sponsoring organizations would certainly appreciate the efforts of people who collect data before and after GIS Day, so feel free to start collecting early and continue collecting after, but these submissions will not be considered for an award.</p>

        <p>The participant with the highest number of points from verified submissions at the conclusion of the GIS Day event will be awarded 1<sup>st</sup> place. The next highest number will be awarded 2<sup>nd</sup> place, and the next 3<sup>rd</sup> place.</p>

        <p>Winners will be awarded with prizes generously provided by the Texas A&amp;M Office of Mapping &amp; Space Information, the Texas A&amp;M Office Division of Information Technology, and the Texas A&amp;M Office of the University Architect.</p>

        <p>Winners will be announced on Wednesday, November 13 at the <a href="https://gisday.tamu.edu/sessions/#/details/cd2b83d2-a084-43d6-b293-418b582b11c5">GIS Industry Panel &amp; Lunch &amp; Awards</a> session.</p>

        <p>Participants do not need to be present at the Awards Ceremony in order to be selected as a winner.</p>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="three">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">Why is this study being done?</h2>

          <p>
            The purpose of this study is to leverage the data collection abilities of the 2,500+ TAMU faculty, students, staff, and visitors who participate in the TAMU GIS Day events per year to gather data about the TAMU campus. Each year, the GIS Day planning committee organizes a GIS Mapping Competition where GIS Day participants gather data (GPS, photos, and other attributes) of amenities and services on campus. You are invited to participate in these data collection efforts!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="four">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">Why am I being asked to be in the study?</h2>
          <p>
            You are being asked to be in this study because you have a relationship with Texas A&amp;M either as a faculty or staff member, a student, or a visitor.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="five">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">How many people will be asked to be in the study?</h2>
          <p>
            The study organizers hope to engage 2,500 study participants per year for each of the four years of the project. We will contact 50,000 people per year (roughly the number all TAMU students, faculty, and staff) in order to achieve these participant numbers for each year of the project.

        <div class="trailer-1" id="six">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">What are the alternatives to being in this study?</h2>
          <p>
            The alternative to being in the study is not to participate. Participation in this study is not mandatory, and non-participation will not impact you in any fashion.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="seven">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">What will I be asked to do in this study?</h2>

          <p>
            You will be asked to walk around the TAMU campus and take pictures of buildings. In 2019, you are being asked to take pictures of the exteriors of TAMU structures. In future years, the organizing committee will survey different aspects of the TAMU campus.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="eight">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">Are there are risks to me?</h2>

          <p>
            The things that you will be doing will pose no greater risks than the you would come across in everyday life. While collecting data, you will be submitting your location (actually the location of the thing you are collecting about), which could expose the locations that you collected data at, should these data be stolen. Other risks include a breach of confidentiality should study information about you (name, email, TAMU department, and TAMU classification) be stolen.

        </div>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="nine">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">Will there be any costs to me?</h2>
          <p>
            Aside from your time, there are no costs for taking part in the study. Your participation can take any amount of time up to seven days (the full length of the week around GIS Day), but we expect that most people will participate for less than two hours.

        <div class="trailer-1" id="ten">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">Will photos, video, or audio recordings be made of me during this study?</h2>
          <p>
            Photos, video, and audio recordings will not be taken of you as part of this study.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="eleven">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">Will I be paid to be in the study?</h2>

          <p>
            You will not be paid for being in this study, but there will be an award given to at least one of the participants who will be selected at random from all participants who create accounts. Creating an account is not mandatory. You can participate anonymously without creating an account, but in this case you will not be eligible for winning prizes (since we won't know how you are!!).

        </div>

        <div class="trailer-1" id="twelve">
          <h2 class="trailer-1">Will information from this study be kept private?</h2>

          <p>
            The records of this study will be kept private. Any personally identifiable information you submit during the course of creating an account will be removed from the data when it is used in publications or presentations. You may choose to submit data anonymously, in which case no identifiable information will be collected from or about you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Research records will be stored securely in the TAMU West Campus Data Center, and only Dr. Daniel Goldberg, other members of the project team, and TAMU IT data center staff will have access to the records. Representatives of regulatory agencies such as the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) and entities such as the Texas A&amp;M University Human Subjects Protection Program may access your records to make sure the study is being run correctly and that information is collected properly.
