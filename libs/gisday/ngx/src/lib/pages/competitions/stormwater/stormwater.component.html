        <p>This year we are yet again bringing hands-on GIS data collection to the masses. In collaboration with Texas A&amp;M Department of Geography and Texas A&amp;M Office of Mapping &amp; Space Information, we are hosting the TAMU Stormwater Survey. The purpose of the challenge is to identify areas and state of drainage and runoff from crowd-sourced photos and surveys submitted by members and guests of the TAMU community. This event is proudly sponsored by the following organizations:</p>

          </div>

          <p>
            Throughout the course of the three-day long GIS Day event(s), any GIS Day participant will be able to submit data in the form of photos 
                          and survey responses of any area on our beautiful campus where discharge, runoff, and drainage infrastructure can be seen functioning
                          or not functioning as designed, with their own personal cell phones through the 
                          official Texas A&amp;M GIS Day Competition App.
          </p>

          <p>
            How data collection works:
          </p>
          <ul class="numbered-custom">
            <li>Install the TAMU GIS Day Competitions App on your mobile device (Android or iOS).</li>
            <li>Find a location on campus that exemplifies discharge, runoff, or drainage infrastructure working or not working as it should.</li>
            <li>In the app, find the competitions tab (denoted by a camera) and select "Stormwater Survey".</li>
            <li>Take a picture with the app.</li>
            <li>Provide details on the photo you are submitting, including the state of the water (moving or flowing) and the approximate depth of it.</li>
            <li>Submit the survey, and find some more!</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="leader-2 aggie-weight-3">How competition points work:</p>

          <div class="flex flex-row justify-around leader-1 trailer-2">
            <img class="medium" src="/assets/images/graphics/graphic-stormwater-2pt.svg" alt="2 Points">
            <img class="medium" src="/assets/images/graphics/graphic-stormwater-1pt.svg" alt="1 Point">
          </div>

            <ul>
              <li>If you provide a completely filled survey and a photo, you receive <strong>one</strong> point for every survey submitted.</li>
              <li>If you provide a completely filled survey and a photo, AND additionally your photo includes a drain, you receive <strong>two</strong> points for every survey submitted.</li>
              <li>Whoever gets the most points, wins the competition.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

                <h2 class="trailer-1">Why is this study being done?</h2>

                <p>
                  The purpose of this study is to leverage the data collection abilities of the 2,500+ TAMU faculty, students, staff, and visitors who participate in the TAMU GIS Day events per year to gather data about the TAMU campus. Each year, the GIS Day planning committee organizes a GIS Mapping Competition where GIS Day participants gather data (GPS, photos, and other attributes) of amenities and services on campus. You are invited to participate in these data collection efforts!

                <h2 class="trailer-1">Why am I being asked to be in the study?</h2>
                <p>
                  You are being asked to be in this study because you have a relationship with Texas A&amp;M either as a faculty or staff member, a student, or a visitor.

                <p>
                  The study organizers hope to engage 2,500 study participants per year for each of the four years of the project. We will contact 50,000 people per year (roughly the number all TAMU students, faculty, and staff) in order to achieve these participant numbers for each year of the project.

                <p>
                  You will be asked to walk around the TAMU campus and take pictures of buildings. In 2018, you are being asked to take pictures of the exteriors of TAMU structures. In future years, the organizing committee will survey different aspects of the TAMU campus.

                <p>
                  The things that you will be doing are no greater than the risks you would come across in everyday life. While collecting data, you will be submitting your location (actually the location of the thing you are collecting about), which could expose the locations that you collected data at, should these data be stolen. Other risks include a breach of confidentiality should study information about you (name, email, TAMU department, and TAMU classification) be stolen.

                  Aside from your time, there are no costs for taking part in the study. Your participation can take any amount of time up to seven days (the full length of the week around GIS Day), but we expect that most people will participate for less than two hours.

                  Research records will be stored securely in the College of Geosciences data center located in the basement of the O&amp;M Building, and only Dr. Daniel Goldberg, other members of the project team, and TAMU IT data center staff will have access to the records. Representatives of regulatory agencies such as the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) and entities such as the Texas A&amp;M University Human Subjects Protection Program may access your records to make sure the study is being run correctly and that information is collected properly.
