            <p class="sub-section-heading">TxGIS Day, 2015</p>
          </div>

          <p>This year we are bringing hands-on GIS data collection to the masses. In collaboration with Texas A&amp;M Information Technology, we are hosting the Manhole Mapping Challenge. The purpose of the challenge is to locate and tag as many manholes scattered about the Texas A&amp;M campus. Throughout the course of the TxGIS Day event, any TxGIS Day participant will be able to record manhole locations with their own personal cell phones through the official TxGIS Day iOS and Android apps.</p>
