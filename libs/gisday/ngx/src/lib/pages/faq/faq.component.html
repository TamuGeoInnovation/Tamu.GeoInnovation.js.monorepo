          <div>
            <p>
              You can complete the check-in process for any event using the TxGIS Day website while that event is on-going. Follow these simple steps:
            </p>

            <ul class="numbered">
              <li><a [routerLink]="['/signup']">Create an account</a> on the TxGIS Day Website.</li>
              <li>Ensure that you are <a [routerLink]="['/login']">logged into your account</a> on the TxGIS Day Website.</li>
              <li><a [routerLink]="['/sessions']">Find the event you are attending</a> and click on it to open its details page.</li>
              <li>
                While the event is underway, click on the Check-in button that is visible on the event details page. This will only work during the time period of the event.
              </li>
              <li>
                There will be event volunteers in every session as well as TxGIS Day staff at the check-in tables outside of each session who can assist you with checking in if you need help.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="trailer-2 faq-item" id="attendance-certification-website">
          <p (click)="onFaqItemClick($event)">How do I certify my attendance using the GIS Day Website?</p>
          <div>
            <p>
              You can certify your attendance at any of the TxGIS Day events using the TxGIS Day website. Follow these simple steps:
            </p>
            <ul class="numbered">
              <li><a [routerLink]="['/signup']">Create an account</a> on the TxGIS Day Website.</li>
              <li>Make sure that you are <a [routerLink]="['/login']">logged into your account</a> on the TxGIS Day Website.</li>
              <li><a [routerLink]="['/account/my-classes']">Open the My Classes menu item on the TxGIS Day website</a> and select all of the classes that you want to notify professors for.</li>
              <li>While the event it underway, follow the <a [routerLink]="['/faq']" fragment="website-checkin">check-in instructions</a> to check-in at the event.</li>

        <div class="trailer-2 faq-item" id="app-checkin">
          <p (click)="onFaqItemClick($event)">Is there a GIS Day App for Android or iOS?</p>
          <div>
            <p>
              There are no longer apps for TxGIS Day in the Google Play or Apple App stores. They are no longer needed, since all functions of the site work on mobile devices, including the check-in process and the data collection competition.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have previously installed a version of the TxGIS Day app for Android or iOS, you can safely uninstall it.
