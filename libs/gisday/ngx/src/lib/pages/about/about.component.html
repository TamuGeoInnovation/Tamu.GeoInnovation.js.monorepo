        <div class="column9 content-block">
          <p>
            The TAMU GIS Day Committee has unique and personal relationships with many employers in the fields of
            Geography, Geographic Information Science & Technology (GIST), and the broader Geospatial Industry. These
            employers are actively seeking to recruit undergraduate, graduate, and former students from Texas A&amp;M
            University to fill
            full time and internship roles.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2018, the TAMU GIS Day Committee organized the first TAMU GIS Resume Bank
            to make sure that our current and former students receive the highest number of resume reviews by the
            highest number of potential employers.
            This resource is provided to companies and organizations who request access to Texas A&amp;M's
            best GIS students from across the university (there are no less than three TAMU Colleges and Departments
            which offer
            GIS training).
          </p>
          <p class="aggie-weight-4 leader-1">
            Participation
          </p>
          <p>
            Any current or former student at TAMU is eligible to add her or his resume to our GIS Resume Bank.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participation in this initiative is voluntary on the part of our students. No student will be required to
            add her or his resume to the GIS Resume Bank as a condition for graduation or grades in a course. A
            student's
            optional
            contribution of her or his resume into the GIS Resume Bank will be used to help her/him/them find an
            internship or
            full time position. Accordingly, any information voluntarily provided by a student into this system will
            be shared with potential employers on their behalf as requested by employers.
          </p>
          <p class="aggie-weight-4 leader-1">
            Student Resume Inclusion Criteria
          </p>
          <p>
            Quality standards will apply. If your resume does not reflect well on yourself or TAMU, it will not be
            included in the TAMU GIS Resume Bank. You may or may not be notified if this is the case, depending on
            the volume of resumes submitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Current and former students may resubmit their resume as many times as they would like as
            new experience, skills, etc. are obtained and their resume gets better and better.
            Only the latest submission will be shared with potential employers.
