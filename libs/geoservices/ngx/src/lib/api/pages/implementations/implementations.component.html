  <p>The Geoservices Geocoding API is available to developers in several ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Raw HTTP, REST, or SOAP requests</li>
    <li>
      Client JavaScript Libraries
      <ul>
        <li>CDN</li>
        <li>NPM</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Raw requests offer the greatest flexibility for developers allowing custom implementations based on their programming language of choice and consuming application formats (json, xml, csv, tsv, etc.)</p>

  <p>Using the hosted version, through a CDN (Content Delivery Network), is best for applications that do not utilize a package manager like NPM. Simply add the script requirement to the head of your webpage and you're off to the races!</p>

  <p>For projects utilizing the NPM package manager, module installation is done through its CLI and imported into your project. This has the benefit of including the API client library into your project and releasing network external dependencies (CDN) that could impact your application load times and performance. Furthermore, the client API libraries are written with TypeScript so developers get the added benefit of JSDoc or native TypeScript typings in supported IDE's or Code Editors.</p>

  <p>The base API for all Geoservices API's is:</p>

  <div class="service-endpoint">
    <div class="service-verb get">GET</div>
    <div class="service-address">https://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/</div>
  </div>

<section id="authentication">
  <h2>Authentication</h2>

  <p>All Geoservices API's require an API key to process requests. If you have a Geoservices account, your key will be located in your <a href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">account settings</a> page. If you don't yet have an account, <a href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating one</a> is easy and free.</p>

  <p>Please note that your API key is the secret key to your account and credit balance. Releasing your API key could lead to malicious parties using up your quota. Please ensure you don't expose your API key in public-facing web applications or store them in version control. Should your key become compromised, please contact us and we can issue a new API key.</p>

<section id="quota-rate-limits">
  <h2>Quota and Rate Limits</h2>

  <p>All registered users receive a daily quota of free credits that can be used for development and testing purposes. In order to ensure a consistent level of service quality for all of our users, all requests are rate-limited based on their subscription level.</p>
</section>

<section id="raw-requests">
  <h2>Raw Queries</h2>

  <p>Our services can be called using any implementation that allows querying HTTP, REST, or SOAP resource endpoints. One of the simplest ways to make use of the API's through a front-end application is by building the request URL and making a call with the native <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fetch API</a>:</p>

  <pre><code [highlight]="'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Proantagonist/Geoservices-Doc-Test/master/quick-start/raw-fetch.js' | codeFromUrl | async" [lineNumbers]="true"></code></pre>

  <p>Browser support for the Fetch API is "good enough" for most applications, however if even broader support is required then querying the API with more lower-level XMLHttpRequests API is in order. Furthermore, both the Fetch API and the XMLHttpRequest API's are only available in browser environments and so they are not available to NodeJS developers working on non-browser projects. Node developers will have to use a third-party library for XHR requests.</p>

<section id="library-sdks">
  <h2>Libraries &amp; SDK's</h2>

  <p>Alternatively, we provide a small first-party, open-source, JavaScript client library (with support for for other languages in the future) for use in browser and Node applications to reduce the boilerplate required to create API requests and handle errors, facilitating service consumption. It provides XHR wrappers for the following services:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Geocoding</li>
    <li>Reverse Geocoding</li>
    <li>Address Parsing/Processing</li>
    <li>Census Intersection</li>
    <li>K-Nearest</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To use in browser applications without a package manager:</p>

  <pre><code [highlight]="'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Proantagonist/Geoservices-Doc-Test/master/quick-start/script-import.html' | codeFromUrl | async" [lineNumbers]="true"></code></pre>

  <p>For browser applications using package managers using ES6 import statements:</p>

  <pre><code [highlight]="'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Proantagonist/Geoservices-Doc-Test/master/quick-start/es6-import.js' | codeFromUrl | async" [lineNumbers]="true"></code></pre>

  <p>Finally, using CommonJS's <code>require</code>:</p>

  <pre><code [highlight]="'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Proantagonist/Geoservices-Doc-Test/master/quick-start/node-import.js' | codeFromUrl | async" [lineNumbers]="true"></code></pre>

  <p>After importing the respective service class or classes, create an instance providing API parameters as constructor object arguments and call the <code>execute</code> method with the appropriate overload that matches your application's consumption pattern:</p>

  <pre><code [highlight]="'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Proantagonist/Geoservices-Doc-Test/master/quick-start/class-consumption.js' | codeFromUrl | async" [lineNumbers]="true"></code></pre>
