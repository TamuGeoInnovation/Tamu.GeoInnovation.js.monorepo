<h1 class="trailer-1 leader-2">Say hello to the new <span class="emphasis">Geoservices</span>! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<h3>We've been hard at work and are excited to unveil the new and improved version of Texas A&amp;M University Geoservices website!</h3>

<h4 class="leader-1"><strong>What's new?</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Redesign:</strong> The underlying core and technologies remain unchanged. You can expect zero impact in your API or batch processing integrations. This update simply brings a sleek fresh coat of paint to simplify and streamline our product pages. This also means our website is finally responsive and looks great on all devices!</p>

<p><strong>Reworked documentation</strong>: We have standardized and re-written all of our service documentation pages to make it easier to explore and discover the meaning behind all of our product output fields.</p>

<p><strong>First-party JavaScript library</strong>: Our commitment to make our services easy to use and integrate into other websites and services remains unwavering. If you're a developer, you'll be excited to discover our new first-party JS library compatible with browser and Node environments. Head over to the <a routerLink="docs/getting-started">docs</a> to get started!</p>

<h4 class="leader-1"><strong>What's next?</strong></h4>

<p>We will continue to improve and refine this new iteration of the website. If you find any unexpected bugs or issues, please <a routerLink="contact/bug-report">let us know</a> so we can address them.</p>

<p>Thank you for your continued support and we look forward to serving you in the future!</p>

<p>If you would prefer to use the old version of Geoservices, you may continue to do so.</p>

<p>The old version of Geoservices will remain accessible at <a href="https://legacy.geoservices.tamu.edu" target="_blank">legacy.geoservices.tamu.edu</a> for the forseeable future but updates to that version will cease at the end of 2023. We have made every effort to ensure we have feature parity for our most utilized products. If we have missed any or have any other feedback, please reach out and <a routerLink="contact/bug-report">let us know</a>.</p>
