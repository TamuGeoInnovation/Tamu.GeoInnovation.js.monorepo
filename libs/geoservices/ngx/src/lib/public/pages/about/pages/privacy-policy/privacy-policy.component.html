      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Texas A&M University (TAMU) respects your privacy and is committed to ensuring that any personal or confidential information that is collected is kept accurate and secure from unauthorized access. The University's campus homepage, and any other campus website linking to this page, does not collect personal information about visitors. We may, however, use third party analytics services that may use browser cookies to anonymously collect and track site usage information. This information then analyzed as an aggregate, and no personally identifiable information is collected.</p>

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>This Privacy and Security Statement applies to the TAMU campus homepage - www.tamu.edu and any site explicitly linking to it. Since the TAMU web community consists of hundreds of websites, other websites may adopt different privacy and security statements as their specific needs require. The TAMU homepage, as well as other sites across campus, contain links to various external websites. The University is not responsible for the privacy and security practices or the content of external websites linked to.</p>

      <h3>Information Gathered by TAMU</h3>
      <p>Personal information that you provide via email or through other online means will be used only for purposes necessary to serve your needs, such as responding to an inquiry or other request for information. This may involve redirecting your inquiry or comment to another person or department better suited to meeting your needs.</p>

      <p>Our site does use server logs to collect information concerning your internet connection and general information about your visit to our website. This information may be used to analyze trends; to create summary statistics for the purpose of determining technical design specifications; and to identify system performance or problem areas.</p>

      <p>This means we sometimes acquire, record, and analyze portions of the data that is entered into, stored on, and/or transmitted through this site by you. This information is only released &mdash; when legally required &mdash; to help law enforcement investigations, legal proceedings or internal investigations of TAMU rule and regulation violations. These groups would use the information to track the electronic interactions back to the source computer(s) or account(s).</p>

      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>A cookie file contains unique information that a website can use to track such things as passwords, pages you have visited, the date you last looked at a specific page, and to identify your session at a particular website. We do not use cookies to track or collect any information that could personally identify individual visitors.</p>

      <h3>Server Log Information</h3>
      <p>The following information is collected from server logs for analysis. Note that other servers across campus might collect different data elements.</p>

        <li>User/client hostname - The hostname (or IP address if DNS is disabled) of the user/client requesting access</li>
        <li>HTTP header, "user agent" - The user-agent information includes the type of browser, its version, and the operating system it is running on</li>
        <li>HTTP header, "referrer" - The referrer specifies the page from which the client accessed the current page</li>

      <p>Some web pages at Texas A&M University may collect personal information about visitors and use that information for purposes other than those stated above. Each web page that collects information will have a separate privacy and security statement that will tell you how that information is used.</p>

      <p>Except for education records governed by FERPA, all information collected from this website, including the summary server log information, emails sent to the website, and information collected from web-based forms, may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act.
