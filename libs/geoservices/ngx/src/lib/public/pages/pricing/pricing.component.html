      <div class="qa-block" id="free-tier">
        <h3>Do you offer a free tier?</h3>
        <p>All registered users get an initial allotment of 2,500 credits.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-block" id="more-credit-options">
        <h3>What if I need more credits?</h3>
        <p>If you need more than the the initial 2,500, you can pay for one-time or monthly recurring credit packages.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- <div class="qa-block" id="partner-program">
        <h3>What is the Partner Program?</h3>

        <p>The partner program grants participants an unlimited number of credits in batches of 2,500. Once you run out of credits, simply log into your account and <a [href]="url + '/UserServices/Payments/Partners/'">click one button</a> to top off your balance as frequently as you need. In return all we ask is that you link to our site from yours, or cite us in your work if a link is not possible. To meet the objective of the program, all links and citations must be publicly accessible.</p>

      <div class="qa-block" id="service-throttle">
        <h3>Do you throttle your services?</h3>

        <p>No.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-block" id="sla-info">
        <h3>Do you offer Service Level Agreements?</h3>

        <p>Yes. If you anticipate needing to process a large number of records for long periods of time such as in a scheduled, automated, or web-service type process, we offer service level agreements whereby a user can pay one set price per month and process up to a certain amount of records (including unlimited). For information about this option or for a pricing quote, please <a routerLink="/contact" [queryParams]="{subject: 'SLA Inquiry'}">contact us</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-block" id="refund-policy">
        <h3>What is your refund policy?</h3>

        <p>Unfortunately we are not able to provide refunds to customers who make payments to use our services. This policy is in place because we offer 2500 free credits upon registration to provide our users the ability to test the quality of our services to ensure that they will meet their particular needs before making any form of purchase. Our services are provided as-is and each individual user is responsible for and advised to determine if our services will meet their specific needs prior to making a payment. For questions or concerns about this policy, please feel free to <a routerLink="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
