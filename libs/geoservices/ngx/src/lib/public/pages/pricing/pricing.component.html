      <div class="qa-block" id="free-tier">
        <h3>Do you offer a free tier?</h3>
        <p>It depends on how much processing you need to do. Most users will never have to pay to use our services as
          they are provided <strong>free of charge</strong> in allotments of 2,500 transactions. To take advantage of
          this, users must enroll in our <a [routerLink]="['.']" fragment="partner-program">Partner Program</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-block" id="more-credit-options">
        <h3>What if I need more credits?</h3>
        <p>If you need more than the the initial 2,500, you have two options:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pay for one-time or monthly recurring credit packs</li>
          <li>Enroll in the <a [routerLink]="['.']" fragment="partner-program">Partner Program</a></li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-block" id="partner-program">
        <h3>What is the Partner Program?</h3>

        <p>The partner program grants participants an unlimited number of credits in batches of 2,500. Once you run out
          of credits, simply log into your account and <a
            href="https://geoservices.tamu.edu/UserServices/Payments/Partners/">click one button</a> to top off your
          balance as frequently as you need. In return all we ask is that you link to our site from yours, or cite us in
          your work if a link is not possible. To meet the objective of the program, all links and citations must be
          publicly accessible.</p>

      <div class="qa-block" id="more-credits-actions">
        <h3>How do I get more credits?</h3>

        <p>If you are a partner who would rather not have to manually add more credits by continually requesting them
          through the site, or you need to process more records than are allocated in batches under the partner program,
          or you are a user who would just like to donate some money to help improve our services, you can purchase
          credits online using your credit or PayPal account according to our service rates.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-block" id="service-throttle">
        <h3>Do you throttle your services?</h3>

        <p>Yes, in a way. We throttle the free usage of our services to batches of 2,500 records at a time to ensure
          that all free users get the same level of service given our available computing resources. Users who sign up
          as partners can process as many records as they like, they just need to re-fill their account by submitting a
          form from within their account once their balance drops below 2,500 records.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-block" id="sla-info">
        <h3>Do you offer Service Level Agreements?</h3>

        <p>Yes we do. If you anticipate needing to process a large amo t of records for a long period of time for which
          manually adding credits via the partner forms on the website would not be an acceptable option such as in a
          scheduled, automated, or web-service type process, we offer service level agreements whereby a user can pay
          one set price per month and process up to a certain amount of records (including unlimited). For information
          about this option or for a pricing quote, please <a routerLink="/contact"
            [queryParams]="{subject: 'SLA Inquiry'}">contact us</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-block" id="refund-policy">
        <h3>What is your refund policy?</h3>

        <p>Unfortunately we are not able to provide refunds to customers who make payments to use our services. This
          policy is in place because we provide our users the ability to process as much data as they wish for free
          under the terms of the Partner Program. As such, any and all users have both the ability and ample opportunity
          to test the quality of our services to ensure that they will meet their particular needs before making any
          form of purchase. Our services are provided as-is and each individual user is responsible for and advised to
          determine if our services will meet their specific needs prior to making a payment. For questions or concerns
          about this policy, please feel free to contact us using the contact form.</p>
