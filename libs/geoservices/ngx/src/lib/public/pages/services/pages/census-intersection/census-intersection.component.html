      <h2>Turn Points Into Knowledge</h2>
      <p>The absolutely most simple thing that you can do is intersect your geocoded output with Census tract boundaries to figure out which Census tract the geocoded location is located within. Extremely simple, but yet the <strong>basis for most research that uses geocoded data</strong>.</p>

      <p>Using this service, you can get back Census tract, block, and block group information from the 1990, 2000, and/or 2010 US Census. These data allow you to link your points with socio-demographic variables from the Census as well as other administrative data such as voting and school districts.</p>

      <h2>User-Friendly API</h2>
      <h4>Built by developers, for developers</h4>
      <p>Our census intersection service provides a simple, unified, language-agnostic API that enables developers to easily integrate our geocoding service into custom applications. We provide a handful of first-party libraries for common programming langues that further accelerates development so you can spend less time worrying about the intricacies of the API and more time focusing on what matters; your application.</p>

      <h2>Batch Database Address Normalization</h2>
      <h4>Manage large datasets with ease</h4>

      <p>If you have a database of address that you would like to have latitude and longitude values for upload your database and run our geocoding service over it. The process occurs on our servers, so all you have to do is sit back and relax; we'll notify you when the process is complete and results available for download.</p>
