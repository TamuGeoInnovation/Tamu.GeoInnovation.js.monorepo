      <!-- <h2>Geocoding in the Fight Against the COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>

      <p>The distribution of COVID-19 cases in the United States can be described geographically. Accurate geocoding is a valuable resource used to convert human-retable addresses into latitude and longitude pair values that can further be used for geo-spatial analysis.</p>

      <p>Geocoding costs at scale quickly add up. Texas A&amp;M is eager to facilitate the ongoing efforts by the public health community against the COVID-19 pandemic by eliminating the financial barrier.</p> -->

      <h2>Crowd-Sourced COVID-19 Lockdown and Testing Sites</h2>

      <p>As part of Texas A&amp;M's commitment to assist the health care community and general public, this website is an effort to collect and maintain an accurate and up-to-date database of county lockdowns and testing centers/facilities. These collected data are part of a larger series of services provided to facilitate dissemination.</p>

      <p>Anybody is free and encouraged to submit new testing sites as they become available, or update existing information. All submissions are reviewed by a committee of qualified professionals to ensure the quality of data.</p>

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <h4></h4>

      <p>The Texas A&amp;M GeoInnovation Service Center is undertaking several efforts to provide the resources and information needed by professionals and the public.</p>

      <tamu-gisc-stepper>

            <span class="material-icons">assignment</span>
            <p>Collection</p>
          </ng-template>

          <p>Volunteered geographic information (VGI) can be difficult to collect and maintain. Texas A&amp;M GeoInnovation Service Center seeks to establish a standardized reporting format for information on counties, lockdowns, and testing sites.</p>
        </tamu-gisc-step>

            <span class="material-icons">all_out</span>
            <p>Dissemination</p>
          </ng-template>

          <p>Collected crowd-sourced data is used to create visualizations and maps to facilitate the consumption and dissemination of accurate data. In addition, all data is also offered to the general public through API's for use in other applications.</p>
        </tamu-gisc-step>

            <p>Resources</p>
          </ng-template>

          <p>Several other <em>free</em> resources for professionals and analysts actively working in COVID-19 fighting efforts are available. These include geographic data sets as well as unlimited use of our Geocoding services.</p>
