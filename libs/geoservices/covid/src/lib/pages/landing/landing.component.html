      <p>The distribution of COVID-19 cases in the United States can be described geographically. Accurate geocoding is a valuable resource used to convert human-retable addresses into latitude and longitude pair values that can further be used for geo-spatial analysis.</p>

      <p>Geocoding costs at scale quickly add up. Texas A&amp;M is eager to facilitate the ongoing efforts by the public health community against the COVID-19 pandemic by eliminating the financial barrier.</p> -->

      <p>The Texas A&amp;M GeoInnovation Service Center is undertaking several efforts to provide the resources and information needed by professionals and the public.</p>

            <p>Collection</p>
          </ng-template>

          <p>Volunteered geographic information (VGI) can be difficult to collect and maintain. Texas A&amp;M GeoInnovation Service Center seeks to establish a standardized reporting format for information on counties, lockdowns, and testing sites.</p>

            <p>Dissemination</p>
          </ng-template>

          <p>Collected crowd-sourced data is used to create visualizations and maps to facilitate the consumption and dissemination of accurate data. In addition, all data is also offered to the general public through API's for use in other applications.</p>
        </tamu-gisc-step>
