<p>Thank you for checking out the Aggiemap <em>Beta</em> experience! The Aggiemap team is constantly looking to improve and add features to the platform to increase its usefulness, accuracy, and reliability. This branch is where we roll out the latest and greatest features and fixes that aren't quite production-ready. If you like to live dangerously, feel free to use this version of Aggiemap and get a taste for some of the upcoming features before they become available to everyone else.</p>

<p>Here is a brief summary on some of the notable WIP features:</p>

      <div class="beta-feature--title">3D Mode and Building Models</div>
      <div class="beta-feature--description">
        <p>A feature long in the making, 3D mode has finally arrived! On the top left is a new perspective toggle widget that will switch between 2D and 3D perspective modes. When the 3D mode is enabled, so will a brand new layer displaying detailed building exterior shapes painstakingly authored to highlight the natural beauty of our campus. Together with 3D mode, it enables users to tilt and rotate the map view paving the way for a one of a kind experience and vast possibilities for future development efforts.</p>
