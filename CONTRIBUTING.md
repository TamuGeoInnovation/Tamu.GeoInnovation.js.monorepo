### How can I contribute?

#### Reporting issues/bugs

Despite our best efforts, bugs will occasionally slip through the cracks. If you find one, from text issues to functionality issues please [submit an issue](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues). Issues allow us to keep track of and prioritize fixes. Before submitting an issue, please take a quick stroll through the posted issues and check if it has been submitted already.

When submitting an issue, please try to be as descriptive as possible and include details such as:

- Description of current behavior
- Description of what the behavior should be 
- Steps to reproduce
- Screenshots
- Your device information
  - Device type (e.g. laptop, desktop, phone, etc)
  - Model (e.g. iPhone 11, Samsung Galaxy S11, Dell XPS 15, etc)
  - OS and version (e.g. Windows 10, MacOS 12.5, Ubuntu 16.04)
  - Browser name and version (e.g. Chrome 103, Firefox 103, Safari, etc)

As the issue gets picked up, we might reach out for more information and you might receive emails from us.

#### Suggesting enhancements

Aggiemap is far from perfect; if you have any ideas for features or changes that would improve the usability and experience we would love to hear from you. Like bugs, enhancements are tracked as [issues with the "enhancement" label](https://github.com/TamuGeoInnovation/Tamu.GeoInnovation.js.monorepo/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement).

Before submitting a feature or enhancement, please glance over the outstanding list and make sure it hasn't already been suggested.

The format for a suggestion/enhancement is as follows:

- Description of the current behavior (if any)
- Explanation on the utility and usefulness of the suggested change
- Step-by-step description of what the proposed behavior would look like and how a user would interact with it
- If you have the technical background, a list of resources such as required data, libraries, packages, etc. Pseudo-code is also acceptable

Additionally, the following would be particularly useful for UI, design, and complex user flows:
- Sketches or diagrams
- Animations


#### Pull requests

In order to make everyone's life easier, there are some guidelines that must be followed to ensure that any contributions improve not only the functionality but the quality of the code base to maintain some resemblance of maintainability and extensibility.


#### General feedback or inquiries
